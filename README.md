## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Front-End:** React Native
- **Back-End:** Node.js + Express / Firebase for real-time data
- **API:** GraphQL or REST API for client-server communication
- **Database:** Firestore / MongoDB for storing user data and posts
- **State Management:** Redux / MobX for managing global app state
- **Real-Time Chat:** Socket.IO for fast and efficient messaging
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time alerts

## 🔥 Why It Stands Out

This project emphasizes **real-time features** and shows how to build scalable mobile apps with:
- Smooth state management
- Rich user interactions
- **Offline capabilities** and **scalability** for better user experience

By integrating push notifications, real-time chats, and offline sync, it demonstrates expertise in managing both user experience and performance optimization in mobile applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a **microservices-based backend**, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of maintainability.

- **Client:** React Native (UI) + Redux (state management)
- **Server:** Node.js / Firebase (backend logic)
- **Database:** Firestore / MongoDB (data storage)
